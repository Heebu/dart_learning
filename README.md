## Introduction

Dart is a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language that is often used for building web and mobile applications using frameworks like Flutter. These code examples are designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of Dart and its practical usage.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run these code examples, you need to have Dart installed on your system. You can download and install Dart from the official website: [Dart Download](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

## Getting Started

To run these code examples, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Heebu/dart_learning.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd bin/1%20DartPractice

3. Use the Dart SDK to run the code examples:

   1 dart.dart


 
## Code Examples

The code examples are organized into separate Dart files, each focusing on specific topics. Here's a brief overview of what each code example covers:

1. **Basic Data Types**: Demonstrates the usage of basic data types such as integers, doubles, strings, booleans, and dynamic types.

2. **Control Structures**: Illustrates control structures like `if-else`, `switch-case`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.

3. **Functions**: Shows how to define and use functions, including optional and named parameters.

4. **Classes and Objects**: Explains object-oriented programming concepts using classes, constructors, and methods.

5. **Collections**: Covers working with lists, sets, and maps, along with various operations like adding, removing, and iterating through elements.

6. **Asynchronous Programming**: Demonstrates asynchronous programming using Futures, Streams, and error handling with `then`, `catchError`, and event listeners.

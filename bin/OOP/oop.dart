/// Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is widely used in modern programming languages, including Dart. Dart is a class-based object-oriented language, which means that it uses classes to define objects and their behaviors.
//
// In Dart, a class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the name of the class, and a set of curly braces that enclose the class's properties and methods.

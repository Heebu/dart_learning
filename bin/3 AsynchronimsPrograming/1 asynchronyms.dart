// asynchronous programming is a way to handle tasks that may take some time to complete without blocking the execution of other code. Asynchronous programming is achieved through the use of Future and Stream objects, as well as the async and await keywords.
//
// Here's a brief explanation of some of the key terms related to asynchronous programming in Dart:
//
// Future: A Future represents a value or error that will be available at some point in the future. Futures are used to handle tasks that may take some time to complete, such as reading data from a file or making a network request.
//
// async: The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous. An asynchronous function returns a Future object immediately, and the actual work of the function is performed asynchronously. The async keyword can be used with both function declarations and anonymous functions.
//
// await: The await keyword is used to wait for a Future to complete and return its value. The await keyword can only be used within an asynchronous function marked with the async keyword.
//
// Stream: A Stream represents a sequence of asynchronous events or data values. Streams are used to handle continuous data sources, such as user input or data from a network socket.
//
// StreamController: A StreamController is used to create and manage a Stream. A StreamController can be used to add data to a stream or to listen for events from a stream.
